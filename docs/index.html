                <p class="body-text-2">Meet Xuan, the inaugural recipient of a GIFTS scholarship. Our paths intertwined in 2009 during a pivotal moment – her father's passing and her mother's health struggles, which led to open heart surgery. A gifted writer and aspiring teacher, Xuan's dreams were momentarily eclipsed as she courageously became the sole provider for her extended family. Our unwavering belief in her potential led us to invest in her education, and she grasped the opportunity with both hands.</p>

              <div class="right-col">
                <p class="body-text-2">Today, Xuan stands as a testament to the power of support and determination. Transformed into a formidable, intelligent woman with a touch of poetry in her every word, she now is a mother. Her aspirations are simple yet profound: "I want to give my child every experience I never had. Reflecting on our first encounter, Xuan muses, "The moment we crossed paths felt like destiny, orchestrated by cosmic forces. Gratitude fills my heart. I am committed to passing forward that same support."  Xuan has bloomed into a dedicated social worker, counseling and paving opportunities for young students on their own journeys. Her story embodies the ripple effect of empowerment, a testament to the enduring impact of a helping hand.</p>

                <p class="body-text-2">We discovered a signficant barrier that hinders education and launched our annual GIFT-A-BIKE program in 2013.  The primary reason for many students dropping out was not a lack of desire to learn, but the sheer difficulty of their daily commute. Imagine young children embarking on an average 12 km walk, enduring a two-hour trek each way, often undertaking this journey alone.  Every year, we raise funds to purchase bicycles for the brightest students who would otherwise drop-out due to the arderous journey to school.</p>

Travelling through Vietnam, we couldn't ignore the harsh reality – families forced to use contaminated water for every aspect of life. From bathing to cooking, the same dirty sources posed serious health risks.
