        <p data-aos="fade" class="body-text-2">Extending our reach to remote communities, we provide education and supply water filters where well construction is unfeasible. Each filter, costing ~150 USD, has the potential to last up to a decade when maintained properly. We work within villages to teach families filter upkeep and stress the significance of clean drinking water, ensuring a lasting impact on their health and well-being.</p>
