        p.body-text-3 We discovered a signficant barrier that hinders education and launched our annual GIFT-A-BIKE program in 2013.  The primary reason for many students dropping out was not a lack of desire to learn, but the sheer difficulty of their daily commute. Imagine young children embarking on an average 12 km walk, enduring a two-hour trek each way, often undertaking this journey alone.  Every year, we raise funds to purchase bicycles for the brightest students who would otherwise drop-out due to the arderous journey to school.
